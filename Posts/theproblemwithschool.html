        <h1>The Problem with School</h1>
        <article>
            <p>So, teachers of FFCA NWE, this might be uncomfortable to read.</p>

            <p>School is broken. Many parts—the way we teach, the way we assess, and the pace of learning—often fail to meet students' needs.</p>

            <p>For example, much of our process still relies on paper and outdated routines. Thoughtful use of digital tools could make learning more flexible and more accessible.</p>

            <p>Since kindergarten, I have sometimes been labeled as "slow." Labels like that tend to stick, shaping how people are treated and how they feel about learning.</p>

            <p>Small interactions matter. Once, while reading a bulletin board, a supervisor told me to stop looking at it—an unnecessary and discouraging response.</p>

            <p>I will keep writing on this topic and share constructive ideas for improvement.</p>
