        <h1>The Problem with School</h1>
    </main>
    <p>So, teachers of FFCA NWE, this is gonna hurt bad. </p>
    <p>School is broken. Plain and simple. The way we learn, the way we are taught, the way we are graded, everything about school is fundamentally flawed. </p>
    <p>First off, the way we are taught is outdated. Why are we still using paper? Why don't we do everything digitally? It's 2026, we should be using technology to our advantage, not clinging to old methods that are inefficient and slow. </p>
    <p>Now, for the saddness that is making my tears water as I type this. So, ever since Kindergarden, I have been knoen as a "slowpoke" and a "grandpa". And I hate it. And this is still true to this day. It is just me. Just the way I work.</p>
    <p>For example, my gym teacher always calls me "grandpa". That, to me, is such a misconseption. Really.</p>
    <p>Also, in the school hallway, at recess, while I am looking at a bullitin board that is meant to be looked at, a supervisor (not gonna mention names) tells me to stop looking at the board! Stop making such a big deal!</p>
    <p>Like, what? I am just looking at the board. I am not bothering anyone. Why is it such a big deal that I am looking at a board? It makes no sense.</p>
    <p>So, we are done for today. I will keep posting on this topic often. Bye.</p>
