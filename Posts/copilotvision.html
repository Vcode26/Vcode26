      <h1>Is Copilot Vision Legit?</h1>
      <p class="lede">A short, hands-on test of Copilot Vision to see whether it meaningfully helps real work. Short answer: not yet.</p>

      <p>I ran the tool through real workflows to judge usefulness and reliability. The interface feels polished at a glance, but results were inconsistent and often missed important context. Audio and narration quality were noticeably poor in my test, and some outputs were just confusing.</p>

        <figcaption>Short clip of the demo showing the interface and narration quality.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Conclusion: promising idea, but not yet reliable for serious workflows. When it consistently understands context and provides accurate, actionable results, I will update this post.</p>

      <p>I’ll continue testing and post follow-ups as the product matures.</p>
