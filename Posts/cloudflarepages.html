            <h1>Cloudflare Pages</h1>
            
            <p>Cloudflare Pages is a fast, free, and surprisingly painless way to host static sites. Think of it as GitHub Pages, but with fewer quirks and a lot more control. I ended up using it after bouncing between a few hosting options that either broke my .mobileconfig MIME type, forced sign‑ups, or tried to "helpfully" rewrite my headers into oblivion.</p>
            
            <p>Pages doesn't do that. It just serves what you give it — which is exactly what I needed.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            
            <h3>⚡ Fast global CDN</h3>
            <p>My files deploy to Cloudflare's edge network, which means they load quickly everywhere. Even when I was testing from a mobile hotspot, the response times were solid.</p>
            
            <h3>🔐 Built‑in SSL</h3>
            <p>No configuration, no certificates, no fiddling. The moment your site goes live, HTTPS is already handled.</p>
            
            <h3>🔄 Git‑based deployments</h3>
            <p>Every push to my GitHub repo triggers a new build. This was especially useful when I was iterating on my _headers file to get the correct MIME type for .mobileconfig.</p>
            
            <h3>🛠 Custom headers</h3>
            <p>This is the feature that saved me. I dropped a _headers file into the repo, deployed, and Pages served the exact Content-Type I specified. No silent overrides. No "helpful" transformations. Just… correct behavior.</p>
            
            <h2>Why I Use It</h2>
            
            <h3>Performance without babysitting</h3>
            <p>I don't have to think about caching, regions, or build servers. It just works, and it works everywhere.</p>
            
            <h3>Security by default</h3>
            <p>Automatic SSL and Cloudflare's edge protections mean I don't have to worry about someone intercepting a config profile or messing with the delivery.</p>
            
            <h3>Zero friction</h3>
            <p>I've used Netlify, GitHub Pages, and a few random "free static hosts." Cloudflare Pages is the only one that didn't fight me when I needed a very specific MIME type. When you're distributing a .mobileconfig, that matters.</p>
            
            <h2>My Workflow Example</h2>
            
            <p>Here's the exact flow I used when hosting my .mobileconfig file:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Create a GitHub repo</strong> — Just a simple folder with my HTML, assets, and the .mobileconfig file.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a _headers file</strong> — Mine looked like this:
                    <pre><code>/profile.mobileconfig
  Content-Type: application/x-apple-aspen-config</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Connect the repo to Cloudflare Pages</strong> — One click, choose the repo, and Pages handles the rest.</li>
                <li><strong>Deploy</strong> — Every push triggers a new build. I used this to test MIME types quickly — commit, push, test on iOS, repeat.</li>
                <li><strong>Verify headers</strong> — I used PowerShell to confirm the server was returning the correct Content-Type. Pages passed on the first try.</li>
                <li><strong>Test on iOS</strong> — The profile installed cleanly with no warnings, no corruption, and no "this file cannot be opened" errors.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This workflow took minutes, not hours, and required zero hacks.</p>
            
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            
            <p>If you want to try it yourself:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Create a GitHub repo</li>
                <li>Add your static files</li>
                <li>Add a _headers file if you need custom MIME types</li>
                <li>Connect the repo to Cloudflare Pages</li>
                <li>Deploy and test</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>That's it. No YAML, no build scripts, no platform‑specific magic.</p>
            
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            
            <p>Cloudflare Pages has become my go‑to for hosting anything static — especially files that require precise headers. It's fast, predictable, and doesn't get in your way. I'll be writing more about my setup soon, including how I validated MIME types, how I structured the repo, and how I tested installation flows on iOS.</p>
